06-04-2016,"The creditor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( aka XXXX ) continues to incorrectly report an account ( XXXX ) on XXXX of my credit bureau reports ( XXXX and Equifax ), even after multiple disputes to have them correct this for the last two years. This closed account is from a former automotive loan. The vehicle was repossessed in XXXX XXXX and went into charge-off status in XXXX XXXX. Further, the account will be 7 years of age since date of first deliquency in XXXX XXXX, and should be removed from my credit bureau reports already, if not soon. Over the last XXXX years, I have spoken with several individuals at XXXX ( last month to a supervisor there ), and each time they agree that it is reporting incorrectly, and each have stated they would get it corrected. The supervisor, XXXX XXXX, has not responded to my voice mails for weeks now. 

Details : Equifax : I previously disputed this more than 2 years ago, and XXXX did not respond to my dispute, so it was deleted. Then, as of XX/XX/XXXX, it was reinserted, but instead of being closed with negative information it is now reporting "" XXXX '' and "" Pays account as agreed '' and shows no former negative account activity. Neither Equifax nor the creditor notified me of this reinsertion per the FCRA law ( which states they have 5 days to do such ). As of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I 've disputed this with Equifax based on that law, and Equifax has opened another investigation. I 've attached XX/XX/XXXX reports direct from Equifax and also from XXXX showing that this account was not listed under my Equifax data, as well as a XX/XX/XXXX report from XXXX showing it has been reinserted under Equifax. 

XXXX : I 've attached a XXXX XXXX report from XXXX showing the account is "" Open '', was late in XXXX XXXX, a repo in XXXX XXXX, and a CO ( charge-off ) in XXXX XXXX. You 'll see on the same report that XXXX changed the dates on the CO to XXXX XXXX, then to XXXX XXXX, yet reporting "" OK '' many times over the years. This XXXX XXXX report shows "" By XXXX XXXX, this account is scheduled to go to a positive status ''. I 've also attached a XXXX XXXX report showing the payment history as completely different than the XXXX XXXX report. It shows COs of XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, which do not match the same COs from the XXXX XXXX report, nor does it show the CO from XXXX XXXX, nor any of the XXXX account data as just discussed from the XXXX XXXX report. Each time an "" OK '' or "" CO '' is reported it changes the active status of the account and moves the date of positive status or deletion in the credit file to an additional plus approx. 7 years. This XXXX XXXX report shows "" This account is scheduled to continue on record until XXXX XXXX. "", also different. 

XXXX : On my XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX report, you 'll see this account is listed in my XXXX data. However, you 'll see in my XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX report showing this account was deleted ( see the bottom of page XXXX of the report ). You 'll also see that it has not showed back up in my XXXX XXXX report. I 've also attached a XXXX XXXX report showing the same XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX proper account history data, which compares correctly to the XXXX XXXX XXXX report. 

Summary : - XXXX : The data should only show that this account is closed and a charge-off, that it went 30 days late in XXXX XXXX, an "" R '' ( repossession ) in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, and then a CO ( Charge-Off ) in XXXX XXXX. It will be 7 years from date of first deliquency as of next month, and should be fully removed no later than then, if not already, just like it has already been removed from my XXXX data. 

- Equifax : Per the FCRA law, this account was reinserted into my Equifax data without proper notification to me, and should be promptly removed. 

- XXXX : This account was already removed from my XXXX data, so no further action there needs to be done.",IDBI Bank,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,VA,Referral,03/30/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2411157

7-26-2016,"I applied for a refinance of my home mortgage with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( company based in Arizona ). I started this process in XXXX of 2014. To date, they have failed to complete the transaction. There have been multiple issues along the way. First, I was told that I would be able to combine my XXXX and XXXX mortgage at a rate of 4 %. After being told that, I started the application process. Shortly after that, I was told the combined loan was not available because I have made a withdrawal from my Home Equity Line of Credit ( HELOC ) in the last year. I had disclosed that fact prior to this time and I was told that an exception would be made because the overall balance on the line of credit had decreased over time ( in other words, I had paid back more on the line that I had taken out ). Even still, I was denied the original offer ( made by XXXX XXXX ). We then proceeded to refinance my primary loan to a rate of 4 %. During this process, there were delays on the part of XXXX XXXX XXXX. They failed to clear their own XXXX XXXX in a timely fashion that resulted in the appraisal of the subject property to expire. By that time, the lender in question had rescinded their offer of 4 %. Instead, a rate of 4.25 % was offered. I was then told that a second lender ( XXXX XXXX ) had offered to refinance the primary loan at 4 %. The process was started again, with a XXXX appraisal. As of today, I was told that upon final review before closing that 4 % was no longer available. Again, I was offered 4.25 %. 

The whole process seems fraudulent to me. A way to delay the process such that loans with best rates are delayed so that they are cleared to close only when rates go up.

This company name Avant Inc, Acct # XXXX .... out of XXXX, let someone get a fraudulent loan in my name for {$3300.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. I went to my local police when I saw it on my credit report. They told me since I could n't prove it happened in their jurisdiction, they could n't issue me a report, there was nothing they could do. They told me to contact the credit bureaus and have them take care of it. So thats what I did. I have disputed this information until I am blue in the face. The credit bureaus wo n't remove this account. 

XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Avant Inc directly by mail. I told them this was a fraudulent account, I asked them to send me copies of the loan agreement contract, so I can compare the signatures. As I know it would n't be mine. They never sent me anything. Of course they going say they did n't receive the letter. So I disputed the account again and it was n't removed. 

So XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote them again and again asked for them to send me copies of the loan agreement contract, so I can compare the signatures. Of course they going to say they did n't receive this letter either. I also spoke to a lawyer, that told me that once, I get the the loan agreement contract, do a notarized affidavit of forgery, and send back with the loan contract signature, and that would be enough proof to show I did n't take out a loan or sign the loan papers, and the company would remove the account from my credit report within 30 days. The lawyer said it was simple business contract law. The signatures do n't match, so the fraudulent contract would be invalid and I would be released from liability, because I did n't opened the account. 

Today is XX/XX/XXXX and Avant Inc, still has not replied to any of the letters and never sent me any loan agreement contract, with my signature. They have not sent me anything. 

How can this company, place a fraudulent account on my credit report? I requested documentation on 2 occasions, they will not send it. This is the 7th month since requesting copies of the loan agreement contract.
