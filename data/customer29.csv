3-25-2019,"The creditor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( aka XXXX ) continues to incorrectly report an account ( XXXX ) on XXXX of my credit bureau reports ( XXXX and Equifax ), even after multiple disputes to have them correct this for the last two years. This closed account is from a former automotive loan. The vehicle was repossessed in XXXX XXXX and went into charge-off status in XXXX XXXX. Further, the account will be 7 years of age since date of first deliquency in XXXX XXXX, and should be removed from my credit bureau reports already, if not soon. Over the last XXXX years, I have spoken with several individuals at XXXX ( last month to a supervisor there ), and each time they agree that it is reporting incorrectly, and each have stated they would get it corrected. The supervisor, XXXX XXXX, has not responded to my voice mails for weeks now. 

Details : Equifax : I previously disputed this more than 2 years ago, and XXXX did not respond to my dispute, so it was deleted. Then, as of XX/XX/XXXX, it was reinserted, but instead of being closed with negative information it is now reporting "" XXXX '' and "" Pays account as agreed '' and shows no former negative account activity. Neither Equifax nor the creditor notified me of this reinsertion per the FCRA law ( which states they have 5 days to do such ). As of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I 've disputed this with Equifax based on that law, and Equifax has opened another investigation. I 've attached XX/XX/XXXX reports direct from Equifax and also from XXXX showing that this account was not listed under my Equifax data, as well as a XX/XX/XXXX report from XXXX showing it has been reinserted under Equifax. 

XXXX : I 've attached a XXXX XXXX report from XXXX showing the account is "" Open '', was late in XXXX XXXX, a repo in XXXX XXXX, and a CO ( charge-off ) in XXXX XXXX. You 'll see on the same report that XXXX changed the dates on the CO to XXXX XXXX, then to XXXX XXXX, yet reporting "" OK '' many times over the years. This XXXX XXXX report shows "" By XXXX XXXX, this account is scheduled to go to a positive status ''. I 've also attached a XXXX XXXX report showing the payment history as completely different than the XXXX XXXX report. It shows COs of XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, which do not match the same COs from the XXXX XXXX report, nor does it show the CO from XXXX XXXX, nor any of the XXXX account data as just discussed from the XXXX XXXX report. Each time an "" OK '' or "" CO '' is reported it changes the active status of the account and moves the date of positive status or deletion in the credit file to an additional plus approx. 7 years. This XXXX XXXX report shows "" This account is scheduled to continue on record until XXXX XXXX. "", also different. 

XXXX : On my XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX report, you 'll see this account is listed in my XXXX data. However, you 'll see in my XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX report showing this account was deleted ( see the bottom of page XXXX of the report ). You 'll also see that it has not showed back up in my XXXX XXXX report. I 've also attached a XXXX XXXX report showing the same XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX proper account history data, which compares correctly to the XXXX XXXX XXXX report. 

Summary : - XXXX : The data should only show that this account is closed and a charge-off, that it went 30 days late in XXXX XXXX, an "" R '' ( repossession ) in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, and then a CO ( Charge-Off ) in XXXX XXXX. It will be 7 years from date of first deliquency as of next month, and should be fully removed no later than then, if not already, just like it has already been removed from my XXXX data. 

- Equifax : Per the FCRA law, this account was reinserted into my Equifax data without proper notification to me, and should be promptly removed. 

- XXXX : This account was already removed from my XXXX data, so no further action there needs to be done.",IDBI Bank,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,Kerala,Referral,03-26-2019,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2411157,Kochi

7-26-2019,"I applied for a refinance of my home mortgage with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( company based in Arizona ). I started this process in XXXX of 2014. To date, they have failed to complete the transaction. There have been multiple issues along the way. First, I was told that I would be able to combine my XXXX and XXXX mortgage at a rate of 4 %. After being told that, I started the application process. Shortly after that, I was told the combined loan was not available because I have made a withdrawal from my Home Equity Line of Credit ( HELOC ) in the last year. I had disclosed that fact prior to this time and I was told that an exception would be made because the overall balance on the line of credit had decreased over time ( in other words, I had paid back more on the line that I had taken out ). Even still, I was denied the original offer ( made by XXXX XXXX ). We then proceeded to refinance my primary loan to a rate of 4 %. During this process, there were delays on the part of XXXX XXXX XXXX. They failed to clear their own XXXX XXXX in a timely fashion that resulted in the appraisal of the subject property to expire. By that time, the lender in question had rescinded their offer of 4 %. Instead, a rate of 4.25 % was offered. I was then told that a second lender ( XXXX XXXX ) had offered to refinance the primary loan at 4 %. The process was started again, with a XXXX appraisal. As of today, I was told that upon final review before closing that 4 % was no longer available. Again, I was offered 4.25 %. 

The whole process seems fraudulent to me. A way to delay the process such that loans with best rates are delayed so that they are cleared to close only when rates go up.

They told me since I could n't prove it happened in their jurisdiction, they could n't issue me a report, there was nothing they could do. They told me to contact the credit bureaus and have them take care of it. So thats what I did. I have disputed this information until I am blue in the face. The credit bureaus wo n't remove this account. 

XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Avant Inc directly by mail. I told them this was a fraudulent account, I asked them to send me copies of the loan agreement contract, so I can compare the signatures. As I know it would n't be mine. They never sent me anything. Of course they going say they did n't receive the letter. So I disputed the account again and it was n't removed. 

So XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote them again and again asked for them to send me copies of the loan agreement contract, so I can compare the signatures. Of course they going to say they did n't receive this letter either. I also spoke to a lawyer, that told me that once, I get the the loan agreement contract, do a notarized affidavit of forgery, and send back with the loan contract signature, and that would be enough proof to show I did n't take out a loan or sign the loan papers, and the company would remove the account from my credit report within 30 days. The lawyer said it was simple business contract law. The signatures do n't match, so the fraudulent contract would be invalid and I would be released from liability, because I did n't opened the account. 

Today is XX/XX/XXXX and Avant Inc, still has not replied to any of the letters and never sent me any loan agreement contract, with my signature. They have not sent me anything. 

How can this company, place a fraudulent account on my credit report? I requested documentation on 2 occasions, they will not send it. This is the 7th month since requesting copies of the loan agreement contract.

This company name Avant Inc, Acct # XXXX .... out of XXXX, let someone get a fraudulent loan in my name for {$3300.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. I went to my local police when I saw it on my credit report. They told me since I could n't prove it happened in their jurisdiction, they could n't issue me a report, there was nothing they could do. They told me to contact the credit bureaus and have them take care of it. So thats what I did. I have disputed this information until I am blue in the face. The credit bureaus wo n't remove this account. 

XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Avant Inc directly by mail. I told them this was a fraudulent account, I asked them to send me copies of the loan agreement contract, so I can compare the signatures. As I know it would n't be mine. They never sent me anything. Of course they going say they did n't receive the letter. So I disputed the account again and it was n't removed. 

So XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote them again and again asked for them to send me copies of the loan agreement contract, so I can compare the signatures. Of course they going to say they did n't receive this letter either. I also spoke to a lawyer, that told me that once, I get the the loan agreement contract, do a notarized affidavit of forgery, and send back with the loan contract signature, and that would be enough proof to show I did n't take out a loan or sign the loan papers, and the company would remove the account from my credit report within 30 days. The lawyer said it was simple business contract law. The signatures do n't match, so the fraudulent contract would be invalid and I would be released from liability, because I did n't opened the account. 

Today is XX/XX/XXXX and Avant Inc, still has not replied to any of the letters and never sent me any loan agreement contract, with my signature. They have not sent me anything. 

How can this company, place a fraudulent account on my credit report? I requested documentation on 2 occasions, they will not send it. This is the 7th month since requesting copies of the loan agreement contract. 

They will not respond, because these documents do not exist. They try to take advantage of the little person, because they are a big multi national corporation.

4-25-2019,Equifax continues to keep allowing incorrect collection accounts on my credit report that have been previously deleted multiple times. When I dispute the collection accounts Equifax states accounts were verified which is not possible because they are not mine. When I contacted Equifax by phone they will not explain how the collection accounts were verified to be my responsibility or what information the company provided to verify them except my name and address. I explained to Equifax anyone can get my name and address because they list it on my credit report. This credit reporting company ( Equifax ) needs to be sued for their lack of investigation and reporting false information on people 's credit report that damages people 's credit rating. I have had the same listed collection accounts in my Equifax report number ( XXXX ) deleted from other credit reporting agencies because the company knows they are not my accounts. These credit reporting companies need to be held accountable for the damage they are creating by their lack of investigation efforts when investigating for consumers. Equifax automatically rule 's against the consumer because they are being paid by the collection companies to keep this false information on the consumers credit reports. I have asked Equifax and the companies listed in my collection investigations to provide me with a contract or a document with my signature showing I have any responsibility to pay any collection accounts I have disputed. Equifax and the companies both have failed to provide me with any proof I owe the amount requested or any other amount they show in collections on my credit report.

9-24-2019,"Navient WILL NOT RELEASE MY CO-SIGNER AND I 'M AT MY WITS END!!! I had a loan with XXXX XXXX, which in turn was sold to Navient. I was issued my consolidated loan XX/XX/XXXX with my ex-husband as my co-signer, since I was unemployed at the time. 

During our divorce filings in XX/XX/XXXX, I applied to have him removed as a co-signer. The request was denied although I was never made aware of the lender 's decision. Last winter, my ex-husband put his house on the market and realized he was still accountable as a co-signer for my loan which seemed to affect his credit. I immediately filed to have him removed again only to find out that I was ineligible due to the fact that I was n't meeting all the criterias, specifically not having missed a payment within a 12 month period. Until XX/XX/XXXX, I had never missed a payment ( the result of me transferring my auto-debit to a newly formed bank account and having it not go through properly, a simple glitch if you will ). I fixed the issue within 10 days. It 's been almost a year and have been waiting until next month to finally file to have my ex-husband removed again as my co-signer. 

This outcome will not be possible. For some reason, although I had schedule my XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX ( something I do every month ) Navient decided to change my due date to XX/XX/XXXX resulting in me somehow "" missing my payment '' therefore adding a {$15.00} fee and of course, now nulling my soon-to-be co-signer release eligibility status. I ca n't understand WHY they would say I 'm late for a payment when the balance should technically carry over, even if one changes the date with a few days. I 'll be blunt, it seems a little too coincidental that at this specific time, I 'm all of a sudden deemed "" late for a payment ''. I suspect foul play to be honest. 

In the past year I have called the customer service many, many times and BEGGED them to consider my track record, even applied online many more times since, but their call center in XXXX insists "" there is nothing they can do since I do n't meet all the requirements ''. Period. The lack of flexibilty is infuriating, especially since I would pay over my minimum for so many years. Especially since I 'm no longer married to my co-signer. I 'm under tremendous pressure from my ex-husband for his release and I am more than capable of paying for myself with my income. I mean, I have impeccable credit ( last I checked it was XXXX ), I have a mortgage that I own all by myself and I ca n't imagine still needing a co-signer. 

I am so very tired of feeling taken advantage of and having very little interpersonal contact with this institution which frankly leaves very little room for customers to be given any fiduciary courtesies. I 'm being told, "" why not refinance with someone else? '' Because I refuse to have another institution make me pay XXXX in interest when I already have paid tens of thousands in interest to Navient/XXXX XXXX already.

7-14-2019,"I have an online account with Bank of America and am able to send wire transfers internationally and have done so many times, usually either dollar to dollar or dollar to XXXX transfers to myself or my husband. This is normal for me. I am a US citizen and XXXX and my work takes me to many locations abroad. This time, I sent a wire transfer on XXXX XXXX, 2015 in dollars to my dollar bank account in XXXX and the intermediary bank used by B or A converted the dollars to XXXX. I was contacted by phone by my XXXX banker and she informed me of the arrival of XXXX from an intermediary bank with instructions to deposit the transfer into my US dollar account. I was asked what I wanted to do because the arriving funds did not match the instructions. I accepted the transfer because the funds were required for a timely purchase. However, I was informed that this type of unauthorized currency conversion by an intermediary bank is illegal in XXXX. Apparently it is not in the USA. In essence, I was forced to accept the poor conversion rate. 

In XXXX I can request from my bank which intermediary bank was used to follow up with a problem, but not with B of A. I learned from B of A that the names of intermediary banks are private information that clients do not have access to. This lack of transparency is disconcerting considering that an unauthorized currency conversion can take place without consequence to any bank leaving the client to absorb any associated negative costs. In this case, I lost about {$620.00} in the conversion. 

I contacted B of A about this incident and filed a claim on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I was told that this was an anomaly and should not happen again. The Associate that I spoke with in the Claims Department 's Money Team filed a claim on my behalf to recuperate the lost funds from the intermediary bank and submitted a request for me to be placed on the "" No conversion list '' with intermediary banks. I was told by the Associate to go ahead and NOT accept the wire transfer if this happened again because this kind of unauthorized currency conversion by an intermediary bank should not be happening. 

Confident that action was being taken and that this was a one-time occurrence, I went ahead with a planned XXXX transfer on XXXX XXXX 2015. Again, I received a call from my XXXX banker two days later who informed me that the same thing had taken place with XXXX arriving from the intermediary bank instead of dollars as instructed on the wire and I was asked what I wanted to do. I followed the advice of the B of A Associate and sent the wire back. After contacting B of A a second time to report that this was indeed NOT an anomaly, I was told that B of A had done everything it was supposed to on its end and therefore had no responsibility for what took place after the money left B of A and was transferred to the intermediary bank in dollars. I was unable to file a XXXX claim because I was told that there is no action that B of A can take since the wire transfer was not accepted and is being sent back. I do not accept this lack of action and lack of responsibility for what was done by an intermediary bank affiliated with B of A to make a profit. 

I would like for this to go on file and hopefully there are enough similar cases of problems with intermediary banks that might support a stronger government position on the transparency for clients related to banks and the intermediary banks they use for money transfers. Clients with international bank accounts are now asked by the government to disclose how much they have in their accounts. This transparency is acceptable. The US government should reciprocate this and support bank clients, and US citizens, by increasing the transparency for normal clients to know the routes through intermediary banks used to complete their money transfers.",Bank Of baroda,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,None,Rajasthan,Referral,07-16-2019,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,1287697,Jaipur

5-23-2019,"The creditor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( aka XXXX ) continues to incorrectly report an account ( XXXX ) on XXXX of my credit bureau reports ( XXXX and Equifax ), even after multiple disputes to have them correct this for the last two years. This closed account is from a former automotive loan. The vehicle was repossessed in XXXX XXXX and went into charge-off status in XXXX XXXX. Further, the account will be 7 years of age since date of first deliquency in XXXX XXXX, and should be removed from my credit bureau reports already, if not soon. Over the last XXXX years, I have spoken with several individuals at XXXX ( last month to a supervisor there ), and each time they agree that it is reporting incorrectly, and each have stated they would get it corrected. The supervisor, XXXX XXXX, has not responded to my voice mails for weeks now. 

Details : Equifax : I previously disputed this more than 2 years ago, and XXXX did not respond to my dispute, so it was deleted. Then, as of XX/XX/XXXX, it was reinserted, but instead of being closed with negative information it is now reporting "" XXXX '' and "" Pays account as agreed '' and shows no former negative account activity. Neither Equifax nor the creditor notified me of this reinsertion per the FCRA law ( which states they have 5 days to do such ). As of XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I 've disputed this with Equifax based on that law, and Equifax has opened another investigation. I 've attached XX/XX/XXXX reports direct from Equifax and also from XXXX showing that this account was not listed under my Equifax data, as well as a XX/XX/XXXX report from XXXX showing it has been reinserted under Equifax. 

XXXX : I 've attached a XXXX XXXX report from XXXX showing the account is "" Open '', was late in XXXX XXXX, a repo in XXXX XXXX, and a CO ( charge-off ) in XXXX XXXX. You 'll see on the same report that XXXX changed the dates on the CO to XXXX XXXX, then to XXXX XXXX, yet reporting "" OK '' many times over the years. This XXXX XXXX report shows "" By XXXX XXXX, this account is scheduled to go to a positive status ''. I 've also attached a XXXX XXXX report showing the payment history as completely different than the XXXX XXXX report. It shows COs of XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, which do not match the same COs from the XXXX XXXX report, nor does it show the CO from XXXX XXXX, nor any of the XXXX account data as just discussed from the XXXX XXXX report. Each time an "" OK '' or "" CO '' is reported it changes the active status of the account and moves the date of positive status or deletion in the credit file to an additional plus approx. 7 years. This XXXX XXXX report shows "" This account is scheduled to continue on record until XXXX XXXX. "", also different. 

XXXX : On my XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX report, you 'll see this account is listed in my XXXX data. However, you 'll see in my XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX report showing this account was deleted ( see the bottom of page XXXX of the report ). You 'll also see that it has not showed back up in my XXXX XXXX report. I 've also attached a XXXX XXXX report showing the same XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX proper account history data, which compares correctly to the XXXX XXXX XXXX report. 

Summary : - XXXX : The data should only show that this account is closed and a charge-off, that it went 30 days late in XXXX XXXX, an "" R '' ( repossession ) in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX, and then a CO ( Charge-Off ) in XXXX XXXX. It will be 7 years from date of first deliquency as of next month, and should be fully removed no later than then, if not already, just like it has already been removed from my XXXX data. 

- Equifax : Per the FCRA law, this account was reinserted into my Equifax data without proper notification to me, and should be promptly removed.

7-26-2019,"I applied for a refinance of my home mortgage with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( company based in Arizona ). I started this process in XXXX of 2014. To date, they have failed to complete the transaction. There have been multiple issues along the way. First, I was told that I would be able to combine my XXXX and XXXX mortgage at a rate of 4 %. After being told that, I started the application process. Shortly after that, I was told the combined loan was not available because I have made a withdrawal from my Home Equity Line of Credit ( HELOC ) in the last year. I had disclosed that fact prior to this time and I was told that an exception would be made because the overall balance on the line of credit had decreased over time ( in other words, I had paid back more on the line that I had taken out ). Even still, I was denied the original offer ( made by XXXX XXXX ). We then proceeded to refinance my primary loan to a rate of 4 %. During this process, there were delays on the part of XXXX XXXX XXXX. They failed to clear their own XXXX XXXX in a timely fashion that resulted in the appraisal of the subject property to expire. By that time, the lender in question had rescinded their offer of 4 %. Instead, a rate of 4.25 % was offered. I was then told that a second lender ( XXXX XXXX ) had offered to refinance the primary loan at 4 %. The process was started again, with a XXXX appraisal. As of today, I was told that upon final review before closing that 4 % was no longer available. Again, I was offered 4.25 %. 

The whole process seems fraudulent to me. A way to delay the process such that loans with best rates are delayed so that they are cleared to close only when rates go up.

The lawyer said it was simple business contract law. The signatures do n't match, so the fraudulent contract would be invalid and I would be released from liability, because I did n't opened the account. 

Today is XX/XX/XXXX and Avant Inc, still has not replied to any of the letters and never sent me any loan agreement contract, with my signature. They have not sent me anything.

This company name Avant Inc, Acct # XXXX .... out of XXXX, let someone get a fraudulent loan in my name for {$3300.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. I went to my local police when I saw it on my credit report. They told me since I could n't prove it happened in their jurisdiction, they could n't issue me a report, there was nothing they could do. They told me to contact the credit bureaus and have them take care of it. So thats what I did. I have disputed this information until I am blue in the face. The credit bureaus wo n't remove this account. 

XX/XX/XXXX I contacted Avant Inc directly by mail. I told them this was a fraudulent account, I asked them to send me copies of the loan agreement contract, so I can compare the signatures. As I know it would n't be mine. They never sent me anything. Of course they going say they did n't receive the letter. So I disputed the account again and it was n't removed. 

So XX/XX/XXXX, I wrote them again and again asked for them to send me copies of the loan agreement contract, so I can compare the signatures. Of course they going to say they did n't receive this letter either. I also spoke to a lawyer, that told me that once, I get the the loan agreement contract, do a notarized affidavit of forgery, and send back with the loan contract signature, and that would be enough proof to show I did n't take out a loan or sign the loan papers, and the company would remove the account from my credit report within 30 days. The lawyer said it was simple business contract law. The signatures do n't match, so the fraudulent contract would be invalid and I would be released from liability, because I did n't opened the account. 

Today is XX/XX/XXXX and Avant Inc, still has not replied to any of the letters and never sent me any loan agreement contract, with my signature. They have not sent me anything. 

How can this company, place a fraudulent account on my credit report? I requested documentation on 2 occasions, they will not send it. This is the 7th month since requesting copies of the loan agreement contract. 

They will not respond, because these documents do not exist. They try to take advantage of the little person, because they are a big multi national corporation.

5-24-2019,Equifax continues to keep allowing incorrect collection accounts on my credit report that have been previously deleted multiple times. When I dispute the collection accounts Equifax states accounts were verified which is not possible because they are not mine. When I contacted Equifax by phone they will not explain how the collection accounts were verified to be my responsibility or what information the company provided to verify them except my name and address. I explained to Equifax anyone can get my name and address because they list it on my credit report. This credit reporting company ( Equifax ) needs to be sued for their lack of investigation and reporting false information on people 's credit report that damages people 's credit rating. I have had the same listed collection accounts in my Equifax report number ( XXXX ) deleted from other credit reporting agencies because the company knows they are not my accounts. These credit reporting companies need to be held accountable for the damage they are creating by their lack of investigation efforts when investigating for consumers. Equifax automatically rule 's against the consumer because they are being paid by the collection companies to keep this false information on the consumers credit reports. I have asked Equifax and the companies listed in my collection investigations to provide me with a contract or a document with my signature showing I have any responsibility to pay any collection accounts I have disputed. Equifax and the companies both have failed to provide me with any proof I owe the amount requested or any other amount they show in collections on my credit report.

9-24-2019,"Navient WILL NOT RELEASE MY CO-SIGNER AND I 'M AT MY WITS END!!! I had a loan with XXXX XXXX, which in turn was sold to Navient. I was issued my consolidated loan XX/XX/XXXX with my ex-husband as my co-signer, since I was unemployed at the time. 

During our divorce filings in XX/XX/XXXX, I applied to have him removed as a co-signer. The request was denied although I was never made aware of the lender 's decision. Last winter, my ex-husband put his house on the market and realized he was still accountable as a co-signer for my loan which seemed to affect his credit. I immediately filed to have him removed again only to find out that I was ineligible due to the fact that I was n't meeting all the criterias, specifically not having missed a payment within a 12 month period. Until XX/XX/XXXX, I had never missed a payment ( the result of me transferring my auto-debit to a newly formed bank account and having it not go through properly, a simple glitch if you will ). I fixed the issue within 10 days. It 's been almost a year and have been waiting until next month to finally file to have my ex-husband removed again as my co-signer. 

This outcome will not be possible. For some reason, although I had schedule my XX/XX/XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX ( something I do every month ) Navient decided to change my due date to XX/XX/XXXX resulting in me somehow "" missing my payment '' therefore adding a {$15.00} fee and of course, now nulling my soon-to-be co-signer release eligibility status. I ca n't understand WHY they would say I 'm late for a payment when the balance should technically carry over, even if one changes the date with a few days. I 'll be blunt, it seems a little too coincidental that at this specific time, I 'm all of a sudden deemed "" late for a payment ''. I suspect foul play to be honest. 

In the past year I have called the customer service many, many times and BEGGED them to consider my track record, even applied online many more times since, but their call center in XXXX insists "" there is nothing they can do since I do n't meet all the requirements ''. Period. The lack of flexibilty is infuriating, especially since I would pay over my minimum for so many years. Especially since I 'm no longer married to my co-signer. I 'm under tremendous pressure from my ex-husband for his release and I am more than capable of paying for myself with my income. I mean, I have impeccable credit ( last I checked it was XXXX ), I have a mortgage that I own all by myself and I ca n't imagine still needing a co-signer. 

I am so very tired of feeling taken advantage of and having very little interpersonal contact with this institution which frankly leaves very little room for customers to be given any fiduciary courtesies. I 'm being told, "" why not refinance with someone else? '' Because I refuse to have another institution make me pay XXXX in interest when I already have paid tens of thousands in interest to Navient/XXXX XXXX already.

4-26-2019,"I have an online account with Bank of America and am able to send wire transfers internationally and have done so many times, usually either dollar to dollar or dollar to XXXX transfers to myself or my husband. This is normal for me. I am a US citizen and XXXX and my work takes me to many locations abroad. This time, I sent a wire transfer on XXXX XXXX, 2015 in dollars to my dollar bank account in XXXX and the intermediary bank used by B or A converted the dollars to XXXX. I was contacted by phone by my XXXX banker and she informed me of the arrival of XXXX from an intermediary bank with instructions to deposit the transfer into my US dollar account. I was asked what I wanted to do because the arriving funds did not match the instructions. I accepted the transfer because the funds were required for a timely purchase. However, I was informed that this type of unauthorized currency conversion by an intermediary bank is illegal in XXXX. Apparently it is not in the USA. In essence, I was forced to accept the poor conversion rate. 

In XXXX I can request from my bank which intermediary bank was used to follow up with a problem, but not with B of A. I learned from B of A that the names of intermediary banks are private information that clients do not have access to. This lack of transparency is disconcerting considering that an unauthorized currency conversion can take place without consequence to any bank leaving the client to absorb any associated negative costs. In this case, I lost about {$620.00} in the conversion. 

I contacted B of A about this incident and filed a claim on XXXX XXXX, 2015. I was told that this was an anomaly and should not happen again. The Associate that I spoke with in the Claims Department 's Money Team filed a claim on my behalf to recuperate the lost funds from the intermediary bank and submitted a request for me to be placed on the "" No conversion list '' with intermediary banks. I was told by the Associate to go ahead and NOT accept the wire transfer if this happened again because this kind of unauthorized currency conversion by an intermediary bank should not be happening. 

Confident that action was being taken and that this was a one-time occurrence, I went ahead with a planned XXXX transfer on XXXX XXXX 2015. Again, I received a call from my XXXX banker two days later who informed me that the same thing had taken place with XXXX arriving from the intermediary bank instead of dollars as instructed on the wire and I was asked what I wanted to do. I followed the advice of the B of A Associate and sent the wire back. After contacting B of A a second time to report that this was indeed NOT an anomaly, I was told that B of A had done everything it was supposed to on its end and therefore had no responsibility for what took place after the money left B of A and was transferred to the intermediary bank in dollars. I was unable to file a XXXX claim because I was told that there is no action that B of A can take since the wire transfer was not accepted and is being sent back. I do not accept this lack of action and lack of responsibility for what was done by an intermediary bank affiliated with B of A to make a profit. 

I would like for this to go on file and hopefully there are enough similar cases of problems with intermediary banks that might support a stronger government position on the transparency for clients related to banks and the intermediary banks they use for money transfers. Clients with international bank accounts are now asked by the government to disclose how much they have in their accounts. This transparency is acceptable. The US government should reciprocate this and support bank clients, and US citizens, by increasing the transparency for normal clients to know the routes through intermediary banks used to complete their money transfers.",Bank Of baroda,Bank account or service,Checking account,Problems caused by my funds being low,None,Rajasthan,Referral,04-28-2019,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,12876975,Jaipur
