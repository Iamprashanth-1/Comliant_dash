Before I signed as a cosigner on XXXX XXXX loan, I had a three way conversation with XXXX XXXX, the school and myself. Found out what she needed and expressed my wants to have the school paid directly with the monies, not to XXXX, XXXX XXXX Rep told me on the phone, it would be done. The following fall, XXXX my daughter did n't return to school, stated she did n't get enough financial help. Two years pass and I get a late notice on monthly payment, then I was told by her brother the reason of not returning to school was that she requested the loan to be sent to her after the original agreement and spent the monies. To verify that I call the financial aid dept. and they said that from the phone conversation in the beginning they waited on the funds but never got that check from XXXX XXXX as agreed. Since that time XXXX, because of being primary has put loan in forbearance, change email addresses for contact and not paid on the loan just to cause issues with me and my credit. I have take her to court 3 times, won the decision that she owes the money and she has told the judge 3 times she does n't owe it and spent the money and I owe it. Because of her owing money to everyone she does n't have anything in her name, just her husbands name. They have a new home, she drives a XXXX Chevrolet Tahoe, her husband works for XXXX, she bragged about how much money he makes and she works and gets paid cash so nothing shows up. She graduated from XXXX, and still pays this payment irregular so it messes up my credit. This last XXXX from what I was told when Navient, the new servicer contacted me in XXXX, she was 90 days late on the payment. They waited 90 days to contact me and it knock my credit rating down almost XXXX points to XXXX. XXXX does n't care because this is a game she plays knowingly that effects my credit because now since I had to retired, by monthly taxable income is {$190.00}. \\r\\nNavient calls me 3 to 4 times daily and sends me emails. When I talk to them and tell them that I cant afford to pay this amount and why do n't they contact her they say they have but contact me more because I am cosigner and then start making threat to me what they are going to do to me financially. XXXX does this to ruin my credit, I should have listen to my son back in 2006 and not signed this. I have tried to contact the Ombudsman department at Navient to resolve this but not response\",\"7\":\"I was advised by rushcard of an update on XX\\/XX\\/XXXX between XXXX and XXXX XXXX. At XXXX XXXX that day i got an email stating it was taking longer than expected but would be up at XXXX. At that time, i was able to use my card, however my balance was not updating. my direct deposit was scheduled to hit both tuesday and wednesday, my balance still does not reflect that. i have no money to pay my rent, or feed my daughter. i need my money ASAP\",\"8\":\"My loan is in default, I have been trying to establish an Income based repayment plan with Delta Collection Agency @ XXXX. I 'm frustrated by their delaying tactics. I have sent in all requested documents even three years of tax returns, reference letters, Hardship letter yet every time I call something is missing, even though a supervisor told me yesterday everything was their. I have the opportunity to restart school but need my XXXX in place first.\",\"9\":\"Citibank continues to make calls to my home concerning a debt for XXXX XXXX. We have told told them onXX\\/XX\\/2015, XX\\/XX\\/2015 XX\\/XX\\/2015, a total of 21 calls, speaking to a XXXX and XXXX this is not our debt\",\"10\":\"To Whomever it may concern, I lost my home to foreclosure in 2006, prior to that I attempted to file for bankruptcy in order to save my home but it failed. During that time all of my bills were in limbo.Once everything fell thru I was contacted by I believe at the time XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and then Pressler and Pressler stating that they had purchased a debt from XXXX for a XXXX telephone bill of {$120.00} to which they state is now well over {$800.00} in which I 'm not even sure is mine. As the years have gone on I finally said lets be done with them and just pay it. I set up a payment arrangement with them and after my second payment, they placed a levy\\/hold on my bank account without notice and proceeded to try and take my money in which the court returned to me. I have been living in fear of them for over 10 years. They have harassed, threatened me and any family members that they could get a hold of. I 've moved and I feel like I 'm in hiding over such a trivial matter but it 's just the response to the fear that I have of them. They are by far the most ruthless and unethical law firm that I have ever come across or know of. I just want to be able to get a bank account with confidence without worry about whether or not they will find a court or judge to sign off on a judgement without knowing all the facts and proof that it 's a debt that I owe. And above all else without proper notification to me. Please help.
